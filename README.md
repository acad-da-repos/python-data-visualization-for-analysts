# Python Data Visualization for Analysts Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will practice creating various data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These are powerful libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find three function definitions: `create_line_plot(df)`, `create_histogram(df)`, and `create_scatter_plot(df)`.
3.  Your task is to implement these functions to create the specified plots using the input DataFrame `df`.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How can you customize the appearance of your plots, such as changing colors, adding titles, and labeling axes?
*   Explore other types of plots that you can create with Matplotlib and Seaborn, such as bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps.
*   How can you save your plots to a file?
